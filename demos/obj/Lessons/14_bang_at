% A class that does not explicitly extend from another implicitly
% extends EnvClass, whose static environment is the top-level environment.
% That means that all classes have access to the top level environment.

define x = 3
define c = class
    static y = x
    static f = proc() +(x, y)
end

.<c>f()  % 6

% Since classes in OBJ are first-class, they can be defined within and
% returned from a proc. It might be useful to resolve symbols in its
% defined environment rather than the static environment.

% Recall `define x = 3` was issued previously.
define d =
    let
        x = 5
    in
        class
            static f = proc() x   % We want let's x ...
        end

.<d>f() % 3      ... but we get the top-level x.

% So we introduce another special symbol !@ that represents a class's
% defined environment. It can only be used with EnvExp.


define e =
    let
        x = 5
    in
        class
            static f = proc() <!@>x   % We want the local x ...
        end

.<e>f() % 5       ... Wuhoo!
