% Since we now have EnvExp that allow us to evaluate an expression
% in an environment, it might be nice to capture any environment into
% an object that can be used with an EnvExp.
%
% To make this possible, we introduce the @ operator which evaluates
% to a value that is the current environment.

define x = 11
define y = 42
define z = 66
define xyenv =
    let
        x = 3
        y = 5
    in
        @       % AtExp
<xyenv>x % => 3
<xyenv>y % => 5
<xyenv>z % => 66 (the `let` extends the top-level env)
