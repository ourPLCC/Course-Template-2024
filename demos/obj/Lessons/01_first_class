% Define a class using a ClassExp that evals to a ClassVal
% and bind (a VarRef containing) that value to a symbol.

define ExampleClass = class end

% Notice that ExampleClass is a variable. We can pass it to a proc
% (OBJ uses value semantics). Similarly we could "return" ClassVals from
% procs. They are said to be "first-class" classes (just like "first-class"
% functions; AKA "higher-ordered" functions)! Just to show that it is a
% ClassVal, let's evaluate our variable for its value.

ExampleClass    % displays "class"

% Let's build a couble ObjectVals from our ClassVal using NewExp.

define o1 = new ExampleClass
define o2 = new ExampleClass

% Convince ourselves they are values too.

o1    % displays "object"
o2    % displays "object"
