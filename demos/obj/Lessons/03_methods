% Let's define accessor and mutator methods for our class.

define ExampleClass = class
    % Fields must be defined before methods.
    field x
    method getX = proc() x
    method setX = proc(x) {set <this>x = x}
end

% Note the use of <this>x above. <this> expresses the current object's
% environment, which allows us to refer to a field that has the same
% name as a local variable (in this case a formal parameter).

% Let's test run our new methods.

define o1 = new ExampleClass
define o2 = new ExampleClass

% Calls formatted to emphasize the AppExp syntax.

. <o1>setX (3)
. <o2>setX (add1( . <o1>getX () ))

% Format of these calls are more idiomatic.

.<o1>getX()    % 3
.<o2>getX()    % 4
