% For debugging, we introduce @@, which displays the current environment
% in a human readable way.

define x = 11
define y = 42
define z = 66
define xyenv =
    let
        x = 3
        y = 5
    in {
        @@ ;    % AtAt
        @       % AtExp
    }

% If we rep the above, among the output the @@ generates the following.
%
%   [x:3]
%   [y:5]
%   ----
%   [x:11]
%   [y:42]
%   [z:66]
%   ----
%
% Notice it displays the contents of the current environment, then `----`
% followed by it's parent environment, and so on.
