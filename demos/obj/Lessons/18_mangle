% We've seen that we can define methods that return the object itself.
% This was useful to define constructor methods that can be called
% in conjunction with a NewExp.
%
%       define A = class
%           method init = proc() {... ; this}
%       end
%
%       define o = .<new A>init()
%
% Developers may apply this strategy to all of their side effecting
% methods that do not need to return a value. This would allow them
% to chain side effecting calls like so.
%
%   .<.<.<.<.<.<new summer>init()>add(1)>add(3)>add(5)>add(7)>show()
%
% To reign in this mess, OBJ introduces !< ... !> syntax to avoid the
% long chain of .< at the front. So now, you can write...
%
%   !<new summer>init()>add(1)>add(3)>add(5)>add(7)>show()!>
%
% That said, this author suggests that you avoid both syntaxes and instead
% separate your calls using the sequence operation. It will also simplify
% your method definitions.
%
%   let
%       s = new summer
%   in {
%       .<s>init() ;
%       .<s>add(1) ;
%       .<s>add(3) ;
%       .<s>add(5) ;
%       .<s>add(7) ;
%       .<s>show()
%    }
