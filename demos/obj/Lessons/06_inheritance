% OBJ support single inheritance.

% Below are several classes in a class hierarchy. Indentation is used
% to help the reader visualize the hierarchy. Remember whitespace is
% ignored by OBJ. It's the extends clauses that tell it which class
% extends from which.
%
% This example demonstrates that multiple classes can inherit from the
% same class (B and C derive from A), and there can be a chain of inheritances
% (D derives from B which derives from A).

define A = class
end

    define B = class extends A
    end

        define D = class extends B
        end

    define C = class extends A
    end

% If a class does not explicitly extend another, it extends the EnvClass.
% The EnvClass is the root of all class hierarchies in OBJ. We'll discuss
% EnvClass more later.

% Most modern programming languages have a class that is the root base
% class of all classes/objects. In Java, it's the `Object` class.
% In Python it's `object`.
